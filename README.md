# @meeg/gridsome-source-kentico-cloud

A [Kentico Cloud](https://kenticocloud.com/) data source plugin for  [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) that aims to support all of the main features of Kentico Cloud:

âœ” Content (including all content element types)\
âœ” Taxonomy\
âœ” Assets

The following features and extension points are also provided to ease working with your Kentico Cloud content in Gridsome:

âœ” Customise how content from Kentico Cloud is represented in the Gridsome GraphQL schema e.g. control how object types are named, how fields are resolved, omit unwanted fields, add custom fields\
âœ” Customise routing of content and taxonomy pages\
âœ” Write your own Vue components to render content components, content links, and assets embedded in Rich Text fields\
âœ” Transform asset URLs directly from your GraphQL queries e.g. specify width, height, format via arguments

---

## Getting started

### Install

Use your preferred package manager to add a dependency on `@meeg/gridsome-source-kentico-cloud` to your Gridsome app, for example:

* `yarn add @meeg/gridsome-source-kentico-cloud`
* `npm install @meeg/gridsome-source-kentico-cloud`

### Add and configure the plugin

Add `@meeg/gridsome-source-kentico-cloud` to the plugins array in your `gridsome.config.js` file, and configure the Kentico Cloud delivery client to fetch data from your [project](https://docs.kenticocloud.com/tutorials/set-up-projects/manage-projects/adding-projects) by specifying your project id in the plugin options:

```javascript
plugins: [
    {
      use: '@meeg/gridsome-source-kentico-cloud',
      options: {
        deliveryClientConfig: {
          projectId: process.env.KENTICO_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID
        }
    }
]
```

> The above configuration assumes that you are using environment variables to manage parts of your project configuration that you want to keep private (or that can vary in different environments), but you could specify the project id directly in the plugin options if you want.
>
>  See the Gridsome docs for general advice on [installing plugins](https://gridsome.org/docs/plugins) and [using environment variables](https://gridsome.org/docs/environment-variables).

ðŸ™‹ This is the minimum configuration required for the plugin to function. Please see the [configuration](#configuration) section for a complete list of all options available.

### Configure Gridsome to resolve Rich Text fields using Vue single file components

Configure Gridsome to use the "[Runtime + Compiler](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#Runtime-Compiler-vs-Runtime-only)" build of Vue because we will need the compiler to enable us to treat the Rich Text field content as a Vue component template.

In your `gridsome.server.js` file:

```javascript
api.configureWebpack(config => {
    config.resolve.alias['vue'] = 'vue/dist/vue.common';
})
```

Add a Vue single file component that will be used to render Rich Text fields. This component is a wrapper around [`v-runtime-template`](https://github.com/alexjoverm/v-runtime-template) and will be extended to resolve other components embedded inside your Rich Text fields e.g. content components, content links and assets.

Create a new `.vue` file under your app components directory e.g. `src/components/RichText.vue`:

```html
<template>
  <v-runtime-template :template="html" />
</template>

<script>
import VRuntimeTemplate from 'v-runtime-template';

export default {
  components: {
    VRuntimeTemplate
  },
  props: {
    html: {
      type: String,
      required: true
    }
  }
};
</script>
```

ðŸ™‹ To learn how to extend this component to render content components, content links and assets (and how to opt-out of this approach if you don't like it), please see the section on [rendering Rich Text fields](#rendering-rich-text-fields).

### Query and render your content

From this point on you are ready to work with your Kentico Cloud content as data in Gridsome ðŸ˜Ž

> If you are new to Gridsome, the following areas of the [docs](https://gridsome.org/docs) should help you get up and running with data:

> * [Data](https://gridsome.org/docs/data)
> * [Querying data](https://gridsome.org/docs/querying-data)
> * [Filtering data](https://gridsome.org/docs/filtering-data)
> * [Paginated data](https://gridsome.org/docs/pagination)
> * [Taxonomy pages](https://gridsome.org/docs/taxonomies)
>
> Remember to use the [GraphQL explorer](https://gridsome.org/docs/querying-data#explore--test-queries) to explore your schema, and test queries when in [development mode](https://gridsome.org/docs/how-it-works#gridsome-develop).

ðŸ™‹ Please keep reading for a more in-depth discussion of the features of this plugin, including descriptions of:

## Kentico Cloud GraphQL schema

The following types of data are sourced from Kentico Cloud and made available for querying via the Gridsome GraphQL schema:

* [Content](#content-objects)
* [Taxonomy](#taxonomy-objects)
* [Assets](#asset-objects)

### Content objects

Content is available by querying against object types named using the codename of the [content type](https://docs.kenticocloud.com/tutorials/set-up-projects/define-content-models/creating-and-deleting-content-types) they belong to converted to pascal case. For example:

* Given the codename `article`, the object type will be named `Article`
* Given the codename `landing_page`, the object type will be named `LandingPage`

#### System fields

Every content object type shares a core set of fields that include:

* System fields provided by the Kentico Cloud delivery client
* Fields required by this plugin
* Fields required by Gridsome

As such, every content object has at least the following fields:

| Name | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `String` | Kentico Cloud's id is used as the object's id |
| `name` | `String` | The name of the content item in Kentico Cloud |
| `codename` | `String` | The codename of the content item in Kentico Cloud |
| `languageCode` | `String` | The language codename of the content item |
| `type` | `String` | The codename of the content type in Kentico Cloud  that this content item belongs to |
| `typeName` | `String` | The GraphQL object type name |
| `route` | `String` | The [route](#content-routing) defined for this object type - if this object's `isComponent` field is `true`, this will always be `null` |
| `isComponent` | `Boolean` | `true` if this object represents a content component; otherwise `false` |
| `date` | `Date` | This is equal to the Kentico Cloud `last_modified` date, but is named `date` because that is the convention in Gridsome |
| `slug` | `String` | This is set to the value of the "URL slug" content element if one is defined on the content type that this content belongs to; otherwise `null` |
| `path` | `String` | This is the path generated by Gridsome and is based on the route defined for this object type |

#### Content element fields

As well as system fields, each object type contains fields that represent each of the content elements of the Kentico Cloud content type that the content belongs to.

These fields are named using the codename of the corresponding content element converted to camel case. For example:

* Given the codename `title`, the field will be named `title`
* Given the codename `page_metadata_meta_title`, the field will be named `pageMetadataMetaTitle`

> If there is a collision of field name a positive auto-incremented integer will be added as a suffix to the field name.
>
> For example, a content type has a Date & time content element with the codename `date` that will collide with the "system" `date` field so it will receive the name `date1`.

All types of content element available in Kentico Cloud are supported and are represented in the object type definition as fields:

| Content element | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Text | `String` | Text fields are represented as strings |
| Rich text | `String` | Rich text fields contain HTML markup and can include [components](#rendering-rich-text-fields) such as links to other content, content components (defined by other content types in Kentico Cloud) and assets |
| Number | `Number` | Number fields are represented as numbers |
| Multiple choice | `Object` | Multiple choice fields are represented as objects containing two properties: `name`, and `codename` |
| Date & time | `Date` | Date & time fields are represented as dates |
| Asset | `Asset[]` | Asset fields contain an array of references to [asset objects](#asset-objects) |
| Linked items | `<Content>[]` | Linked items fields contain an array of references to the content objects they are linked to - the plugin assumes that the objects are all of the same object type |
| Custom element | `String` | Custom element fields are represented as strings |
| Taxonomy | `<Taxonomy>[]` | Taxonomy fields contain an array of references to [taxonomy objects](#taxonomy-objects) belonging to the relevant taxonomy object type |
| URL slug | `String` | URL slug fields are represented as strings - they are regarded as a [system field](#system-fields) and will always be assigned to a field called `slug`, if present |

#### Content components

TODO: HERE!

> Content [components](https://docs.kenticocloud.com/tutorials/write-and-collaborate/structure-your-content/structuring-editorial-articles-with-components) used in Rich Text fields are also added to object types in the Gridsome GraphQL schema although the content component objects will have no route or path as they are not "content" in the usual sense - they are only intended to be used when rendering Rich Text fields.

#### Item links

#### Content routing

### Taxonomy objects

#### Taxonomy routing

### Asset objects

## Rendering Rich Text fields

The recommended way to render child components, links and assets embedded in Rich Text fields when using this plugin is to write your own Vue components that you define in your Gridsome app. It is recommended because it is idiomatic of a Vue component to render components in this way, and preferred to embedding HTML markup into [delivery client](https://github.com/Kentico/kentico-cloud-js/blob/master/packages/delivery/DOCS.md#resolving-content-items-and-components-in-rich-text-elements) requests or `[ContentItem](https://github.com/Kentico/kentico-cloud-js/blob/master/packages/delivery/DOCS.md#url-slugs-links)` classes.
