# @meeg/gridsome-source-kentico-cloud

A [Kentico Cloud](https://kenticocloud.com/) data source plugin for  [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) that aims to support as many of the features of Kentico Cloud as possible:

âœ” Content (including all content element types)\
âœ” Taxonomy\
âœ” Assets

The following features and extension points are also provided to ease working with your Kentico Cloud content in Gridsome:

âœ” Customise how content from Kentico Cloud is represented in the Gridsome GraphQL schema e.g. control how object types are named, how fields are resolved, omit unwanted fields, add custom fields\
âœ” Customise routing of content and taxonomy pages\
âœ” Write your own Vue components to render content components, content links, and assets embedded in Rich text fields\
âœ” Transform asset URLs directly from your GraphQL queries e.g. specify width, height, format via arguments

## Getting started

### Install

Use your preferred package manager to add a dependency on `@meeg/gridsome-source-kentico-cloud` to your Gridsome app, for example:

* `yarn add @meeg/gridsome-source-kentico-cloud`
* `npm install @meeg/gridsome-source-kentico-cloud`

### Basic configuration

Add `@meeg/gridsome-source-kentico-cloud` to the plugins array in your `gridsome.config.js` file, and configure the Kentico Cloud delivery client to fetch data from your [project](https://docs.kenticocloud.com/tutorials/set-up-projects/manage-projects/adding-projects) by specifying your project id in the plugin options:

```javascript
plugins: [
    {
      use: '@meeg/gridsome-source-kentico-cloud',
      options: {
        deliveryClientConfig: {
          projectId: process.env.KENTICO_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID
        }
    }
]
```

> The above configuration assumes that you are using environment variables to manage parts of your project configuration that you want to keep private (or that can vary in different environments), but you could specify the project id directly in the plugin options if you want.
>
>  See the Gridsome docs for general advice on [installing plugins](https://gridsome.org/docs/plugins) and [using environment variables](https://gridsome.org/docs/environment-variables).

ðŸ™‹ This is the minimum configuration required for the plugin to function. Please see the [configuration](#configuration) section for a complete list of all options available.

## Query your Kentico Cloud data

The following types of data are sourced from Kentico Cloud and made available for querying via the Gridsome GraphQL schema:

* [Content](#querying-content)
* [Taxonomy](#querying-taxonomy)
* [Assets](#querying-assets)

> See the Gridsome docs for general advice on [querying data](https://gridsome.org/docs/querying-data).

### Querying content

Content is available by querying against object types named using the codename of the [content type](https://docs.kenticocloud.com/tutorials/set-up-projects/define-content-models/creating-and-deleting-content-types) they belong to converted to pascal case. For example:

* Given the codename `article`, the object type will be named `Article`
* Given the codename `landing_page`, the object type will be named `LandingPage`

> Content [components](https://docs.kenticocloud.com/tutorials/write-and-collaborate/structure-your-content/structuring-editorial-articles-with-components) used in Rich text fields are also added to object types in the Gridsome GraphQL schema although the content component objects will have no route or path as they are not "content" in the usual sense - they are used when rendering Rich text fields.

#### System fields

Every content object type shares a core set of fields that include:

* System fields provided by the Kentico Cloud delivery client
* Fields required by this plugin
* Fields required by Gridsome

As such, every content object has at least the following fields:

| Name | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `String` | Kentico Cloud's id is used as the object's id |
| `name` | `String` | The name of the content item in Kentico Cloud |
| `codename` | `String` | The codename of the content item in Kentico Cloud |
| `languageCode` | `String` | The language codename of the content item |
| `type` | `String` | The codename of the content type in Kentico Cloud  that this content item belongs to |
| `typeName` | `String` | The GraphQL object type name |
| `route` | `String` | The [route](#routing) defined for this object type - if this object's `isComponent` field is `true`, this will always be `null` |
| `isComponent` | `Boolean` | `true` if this object represents a content component; otherwise `false` |
| `date` | `Date` | This is equal to the Kentico Cloud `last_modified` date, but is named `date` because that is the convention in Gridsome |
| `slug` | `String` | This is set to the value of the "URL slug" content element if one is defined on the content type that this content belongs to; otherwise `null` |
| `path` | `String` | This is the path generated by Gridsome and is based on the route defined for this object type |

#### Content element fields

As well as system fields, each object type contains fields that represent the content elements of the Kentico Cloud content type that the content belongs to.

These fields are named using the codename of the corresponding content element converted to camel case. For example:

* Given the codename `title`, the field will be named `title`
* Given the codename `page_metadata_meta_title`, the field will be named `pageMetadataMetaTitle`

If there is a collision of field name an auto-incremented positive integer will be added as a suffix. For example, a content type has a Date & time content element with the codename `date` that will collide with the "system" `date` field so it will receive the name `date1`.

All types of content element available in Kentico Cloud are supported and are represented in the object type definition as fields:

| Content element | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Text | `String` | Text fields are represented as strings |
| Rich text | `String` | Rich text fields contain HTML markup and can include components such as links to other content, content components defined by other content types in Kentico Cloud and assets - [Rich text field components](#rendering-rich-text-fields) are rendered using Vue components inside your app  |
| Number | `Number` | Number fields are represented as numbers |
| Multiple choice | `Object` | Multiple choice fields are represented as objects containing two properties: `name`, and `codename` |
| Date & time | `Date` | Date & time fields are represented as dates |
| Asset | `Asset` | Asset fields contain a reference to an [Asset](#asset-fields) object |
| Linked items | `<Content>[]` | Linked items fields contain an array of references to the Content objects they are linked to - the plugin assumes that the objects are all of the same type |
| Custom element | `String` | Custom element fields are represented as strings |
| Taxonomy | `<Taxonomy>[]` | Taxonomy fields contain an array of references to [Taxonomy](#taxonomy-fields) term objects belonging to the relevant Taxonomy object type |
| URL slug | `String` | URL slug fields are represented as strings - as mentioned above they are regarded as a ["system" field](#system-fields) and will always be assigned to a field called `slug`, if present |
