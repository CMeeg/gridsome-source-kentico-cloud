# @meeg/gridsome-source-kentico-cloud

A [Kentico Cloud](https://kenticocloud.com/) data source plugin for  [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) that aims to support all of the main features of Kentico Cloud:

âœ” Content (including all content element types)\
âœ” Taxonomy\
âœ” Assets

The following features and extension points are also provided to ease working with your Kentico Cloud content in Gridsome:

âœ” Customise how content from Kentico Cloud is represented in the Gridsome GraphQL schema e.g. control how object types are named, how fields are resolved, omit unwanted fields, add custom fields\
âœ” Customise routing of content and taxonomy pages\
âœ” Write your own Vue components to render content components, content links, and assets embedded in Rich Text fields\
âœ” Transform asset URLs directly from your GraphQL queries e.g. specify width, height, format via arguments

---

## Getting started

### Install

Use your preferred package manager to add a dependency on `@meeg/gridsome-source-kentico-cloud` to your Gridsome app, for example:

* `yarn add @meeg/gridsome-source-kentico-cloud`
* `npm install @meeg/gridsome-source-kentico-cloud`

### Add and configure the plugin

Add `@meeg/gridsome-source-kentico-cloud` to the plugins array in your `gridsome.config.js` file, and configure the Kentico Cloud delivery client to fetch data from your [project](https://docs.kenticocloud.com/tutorials/set-up-projects/manage-projects/adding-projects) by specifying your project id in the plugin options:

```javascript
plugins: [
    {
      use: '@meeg/gridsome-source-kentico-cloud',
      options: {
        deliveryClientConfig: {
          projectId: process.env.KENTICO_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID
        }
    }
]
```

> The above configuration assumes that you are using environment variables to manage parts of your project configuration that you want to keep private (or that can vary in different environments), but you could specify the project id directly in the plugin options if you want.
>
>  See the Gridsome docs for general advice on [installing plugins](https://gridsome.org/docs/plugins) and [using environment variables](https://gridsome.org/docs/environment-variables).

ðŸ™‹ This is the minimum configuration required for the plugin to function. Please see the [configuration](#configuration) section for a complete list of all options available.

### Configure Gridsome to resolve Rich Text fields using Vue single file components

Configure Gridsome to use the "[Runtime + Compiler](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#Runtime-Compiler-vs-Runtime-only)" build of Vue because we will need the compiler to enable us to treat the Rich Text field content as a Vue component template.

In your `gridsome.server.js` file:

```javascript
api.configureWebpack(config => {
    config.resolve.alias['vue'] = 'vue/dist/vue.common';
})
```

Add a Vue single file component that will be used to render Rich Text fields. This component is a wrapper around [`v-runtime-template`](https://github.com/alexjoverm/v-runtime-template) and will be extended to resolve other components embedded inside your Rich Text fields e.g. content components, content links and assets.

Create a new `.vue` file under your app components directory e.g. `src/components/RichText.vue`:

```html
<template>
  <v-runtime-template :template="html" />
</template>

<script>
import VRuntimeTemplate from 'v-runtime-template';

export default {
  components: {
    VRuntimeTemplate
  },
  props: {
    html: {
      type: String,
      required: true
    }
  }
};
</script>
```

ðŸ™‹ To learn how to extend this component to render content components, content links and assets (and how to opt-out of this approach if you don't like it), please see the section on [rendering Rich Text fields](#rendering-rich-text-fields).

### Query and render your content

From this point on you are ready to work with your Kentico Cloud content as data in Gridsome ðŸ˜Ž

## Kentico Cloud GraphQL schema

The following types of data are sourced from Kentico Cloud and made available for querying via the Gridsome GraphQL schema:

* [Content objects](#content-objects)
* [Taxonomy objects](#taxonomy-objects)
* [Asset objects](#asset-objects)

### Content objects

Content is available by querying against object types named using the codename of the [content type](https://docs.kenticocloud.com/tutorials/set-up-projects/define-content-models/creating-and-deleting-content-types) they belong to converted to pascal case. For example:

* Given the codename `article`, the object type will be named `Article`
* Given the codename `landing_page`, the object type will be named `LandingPage`

ðŸ™‹ See the section on [configuration](#configuration) for options on how to customise naming of content object types.

#### System fields

Every content object type shares a core set of fields that include:

* System fields provided by the Kentico Cloud delivery client
* Fields required by this plugin
* Fields required by Gridsome

As such, every content object has at least the following fields:

| Name | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `String` | Kentico Cloud's id is used as the object's id |
| `name` | `String` | The name of the content item in Kentico Cloud |
| `codename` | `String` | The codename of the content item in Kentico Cloud |
| `languageCode` | `String` | The language codename of the content item |
| `type` | `String` | The codename of the content type in Kentico Cloud  that this content item belongs to |
| `typeName` | `String` | The GraphQL object type name |
| `route` | `String` | The [route](#content-routing) defined for this object type - if this object's `isComponent` field is `true`, this will always be `null` |
| `isComponent` | `Boolean` | `true` if this object represents a content component; otherwise `false` - see the section on [content component objects](#content-component-objects) for further details |
| `date` | `Date` | This is equal to the Kentico Cloud `last_modified` date, but is named `date` because that is the convention in Gridsome |
| `slug` | `String` | This is set to the value of the "URL slug" content element if one is defined on the content type that this content belongs to; otherwise `null` |
| `path` | `String` | This is the path generated by Gridsome and is based on the route defined for this object type |

#### Content element fields

As well as system fields, each object type contains fields that represent each of the content elements of the Kentico Cloud content type that the content belongs to.

These fields are named using the codename of the corresponding content element converted to camel case. For example:

* Given the codename `title`, the field will be named `title`
* Given the codename `page_metadata_meta_title`, the field will be named `pageMetadataMetaTitle`

> If there is a collision of field name a positive auto-incremented integer will be added as a suffix to the field name.
>
> For example, a Kentico Cloud content type has a content element with the codename `date` that will collide with the "system" `date` field so it will receive the field name `date1` when added to the corresponding object type in the GraphQL schema.

All types of content element available in Kentico Cloud are supported and are represented in the object type definition as fields:

| Content element | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Text | `String` | Text elements are represented as string fields |
| Rich text | `String` | Rich text elements contain HTML markup, but are represented as strings - see the section on [rendering Rich Text fields](#rendering-rich-text-fields) for details of how to render Rich Text fields in your Gridsome app |
| Number | `Number` | Number elements are represented as numbers |
| Multiple choice | `Object` | Multiple choice elements are represented as objects containing two properties: `name`, and `codename` |
| Date & time | `Date` | Date & time elements are represented as dates |
| Asset | `Asset[]` | Asset elements contain an array of references to [asset objects](#asset-objects) |
| Linked items | `<Content>[]` | Linked items elements contain an array of references to the content objects they are linked to - the plugin assumes that the objects are all of the same object type |
| Custom element | `String` | Custom elements are represented as strings |
| Taxonomy | `<Taxonomy>[]` | Taxonomy elements contain an array of references to [taxonomy objects](#taxonomy-objects) belonging to the relevant taxonomy object type |
| URL slug | `String` | URL slug elements are represented as strings - they are regarded as a [system field](#system-fields) and will always be assigned to a field called `slug`, if present |

ðŸ™‹ See the section on [creating content models](#creating-content-models) for details on how you can customise how content elements are translated to content object fields.

#### Content component objects

Content [components](https://docs.kenticocloud.com/tutorials/write-and-collaborate/structure-your-content/structuring-editorial-articles-with-components) used in Rich Text fields are also added to object types in the Gridsome GraphQL schema.

The difference between content component objects and "regular" content objects is that content component objects will never have values in their `route` or `path` fields because they are components of larger pieces of content and therefore not intended to be used in isolation.

The `isComponent` system field can be used to filter content component objects in content queries if required.

#### Item links

> Item links are primarily used when [rendering Rich Text fields](#rendering-rich-text-fields) so feel free to skip this section unless you really want to read it! ðŸ¤“

When editing content inside Rich Text elements in Kentico Cloud you can [add links to other content items](https://docs.kenticocloud.com/tutorials/write-and-collaborate/write-content/composing-content-in-the-rich-text-editor#a-adding-links) within your Kentico Cloud project. To resolve these links within your Gridsome app, the `path` of the content item that has been linked to must be used as the URL of the link.

Gridsome generates the `path` value for an object (based on a [defined](#content-routing) `route`) when it is inserted into the GraphQL schema via the [Data Store API](https://gridsome.org/docs/data-store-api#collectionaddnodeoptions).

To get the `path` of an object in the GraphQL schema you must either:

1. Already have a reference to the relevant content object; or
2. Know the `id` and `typeName` of the content item that has been linked to, and form a GraphQL query to fetch an object with the `id` from the object type that corresponds to the `typeName`

If neither of the above are true, the `ItemLink` object type can be queried using only the `id` of the content item that has been linked to to find the `path` of the corresponding content object.

The `ItemLink` object type has these fields:

| Name | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | String | Kentico Cloud's id and the id of the corresponding content object |
| `typeName` | String | The GraphQL object type name of the corresponding content object  |
| `path` | String | The path of the corresponding content object |

ðŸ™‹ See the section on [configuration](#configuration) for options on how to customise naming of the `ItemLink` object type.

## Creating content models

TODO

The majority of the work required to translate content elements to GraphQL fields is performed via custom `ContentItem` [models](https://github.com/Kentico/kentico-cloud-js/blob/master/packages/delivery/DOCS.md#creating-models) that are automatically passed to the delivery client as [type resolvers](https://github.com/Kentico/kentico-cloud-js/blob/master/packages/delivery/DOCS.md#initializing-deliveryclient).

## Rendering Rich Text fields

TODO

The recommended way to render child components, links and assets embedded in Rich Text fields when using this plugin is to write your own Vue components that you define in your Gridsome app. It is recommended because it is idiomatic of a Vue component to render components in this way, and preferred to embedding HTML markup into [delivery client](https://github.com/Kentico/kentico-cloud-js/blob/master/packages/delivery/DOCS.md#resolving-content-items-and-components-in-rich-text-elements) requests or `[ContentItem](https://github.com/Kentico/kentico-cloud-js/blob/master/packages/delivery/DOCS.md#url-slugs-links)` classes.

## Routing

TODO

#### Content routing

The default [route](https://gridsome.org/docs/routing) for all content objects added by this plugin is:

`/{codename}/:slug`

Where:

* `codename` is the [slugified](https://github.com/sindresorhus/slugify) codename of the Kentico Cloud content type that the content belongs to; and
* `slug` is the [system field](#system-fields) named "slug"

It is possible to override the default route for each of your Kentico Cloud content types using the options exposed by this plugin. To do so you must add an item to the `contentItemConfig.routes` object with a key matching the content type codename you wish to specify the route for, and a value matching the desired route that you wish to use for that content type. For example:

```javascript
  plugins: [
    {
      use: '@meeg/gridsome-source-kentico-cloud',
      options: {
        ...
        contentItemConfig: {
          ...
          routes: {
            article: '/articles/:slug',
            author: '/about'
          }
          ...
        }
        ...
      }
    }
  }
```

The route that you specify can use any [parameters](https://gridsome.org/docs/routing#route-params) that Gridsome can resolve.

> Routes are not resolved in any particular order so you may wish to avoid setting a route such as `/:slug` as this could take precedence and conflict with other routes such as the route for `author` in the above example.
